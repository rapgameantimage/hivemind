	"gameinfo_main_intro"							"In Hivemind, every hero's first ability can be used to enter \"split form,\" transforming into a small army of units with their own unique abilities. You can return to hero form by using the first ability on any split unit."
	"gameinfo_main_death"							"Beware, if all of your split units die, so will your hero!"
	"gameinfo_main_win"								"Be the first to reach 5 kills to win!"
	"gameinfo_main_tips"							"Tips:"
	"gameinfo_main_tip1"							"1. Cooldowns, buffs, and debuffs tick down on your hero even while in split form, and vice versa. Switch forms often to use your cooldowns efficiently and avoid debuffs."
	"gameinfo_main_tip2"							"2. You are invulnerable for a moment while transforming, which can be helpful to dodge enemy attacks."
	"gameinfo_main_tip3"							"3. While splitting, you can cast the ability again before your transformation completes to space your units out more. This is helpful if you're getting shredded by AoE."
